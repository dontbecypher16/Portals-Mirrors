# Portals/Mirrors

This is the project outline for my blog. The topics that will be examined on the blog are virtual reality, web development,
and thoughts on the future and transhumanism. My work will be categorized between essays and poems.
I will have a login page for me and/or maybe a guest writer to post any essay or poem.

I am using Node.js and will send resources to the client with a templating engine using Handlebars.

(Optional)
Thinking about creating where visitors can login and make comments on any of the individual posts.
